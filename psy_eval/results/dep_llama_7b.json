I've been warned by the board multiple times because of my absences, and by teachers, most of them want me to succeed, and I can see that, but It's really hard. I had a motorcycle accident last December when I went back home for Christmas, which resulted in a significant injury in my leg, which resulted in more absences. I've paid a lot of money to move out, I moved out due to depression, but my depression is really hitting me, and I don't think I can hold it until June. I've explained in school most of my problems everyone knew about the motorcycle and a few teachers knew about my depression problems; however, it's way worse than what they think.

I've been warned by the board multiple times because of my absences, and by teachers, most of them want me to succeed, and I can see that, but It's really hard. I had a motorcycle accident last December when I went back home for Christmas, which resulted in a significant injury in my leg, which resulted in more absences.
